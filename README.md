### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach
- Visual layout planning using design image as background

### What I learned

During this challenge, I re-learned how to:
- Properly structure an HTML layout using `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<div>`
- Use Flexbox to build a responsive two-column layout
- Align elements using `justify-content` and `align-items`
- Apply `flex: 0 0 [value]` and understand what each number means
- Fix common issues like invalid margin syntax (`1 rem` vs `1rem`)
- Add background images using `background-image` and position them with `background-size` and `background-position`
- Apply consistent styling to inline SVGs or icons inside lists

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my understanding of:
- Flexbox alignment and responsive behavior
- Grid layout for more complex components
- Media queries for mobile responsiveness
- Organizing CSS better and making it more scalable
